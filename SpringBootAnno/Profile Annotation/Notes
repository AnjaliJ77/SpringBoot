IYou have 2 application and 1 common code base, how will u make sure that, Bean is created for 1 Application. not for other?

Ans:-
@ConditionalOnProperty
and
@Profile Annotation:




@Profile Annotation:
Yes using bothe we can achieve this requirement.
But @profile is technically intended for environment separation rather than application specific bean creation.


How to handle different environment configurations?
(dev use different conf like user name, pwd, port number, connectyion timeout, like wise QA use diff one and In Live we use different one).
--------> We keep the configurations in "Application.properties" file
Using @Profile annotation, we can tell to SB, to create bean only when particular profile is set
