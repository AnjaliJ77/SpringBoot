IYou have 2 application and 1 common code base, how will u make sure that, Bean is created for 1 Application. not for other?

Ans:-
@ConditionalOnProperty
and
@Profile Annotation:


@ConditionalOnProperty Annotations:
Beans is created conditionally(Mean bean can be created or not).


3imp steps:
1. In the sub classes we should mention @ConditionalOnProperty
2. In the conf class mention required as false
3. Mention the proper values into the Application.property


@ConditionalOnProperty is used to enable or disable a bean/configuration based on a value in the application.properties / application.yml file.
👉 Very useful when:
You want feature on/off
Different behavior for dev / test / prod
Avoid loading unnecessary beans

Advantage:
Toggling of feature(In Application.property we can add if we want to create bean for the particular class)
Avoid cluttering App context with un-necessary beans
Save memory
Reduce app Startup time

Disadvantages:
Misconfiguration can happen
Code complexity when over used.
Multiple bean creation with same config, brings confusion.
Complexity in managing
