Bean life cycle:
1. Instantiation

2. dependency injection

3. Performing some operations

4. Destruction


Methods of bean lifecycle
1. Init(after bean is created) : 

2. Destroy(Just before bean is destroyed) :  




@Qualifier:
If there are 2 classes implementing one class, in that case we can use @qualifier annotation



-------MVC:
How to create:
1. We need to add View(HTTPs/frontend)
----> create file with the extension of .jsp
-----> JSP support both HTTML and java.
-----> src/main/weapp/WEB-INF/view/file.jsp
2.  We need to add the dependency for JSP file.
----tomcat jasper mvn
---->jstl mvn
3. We need to inform Spring that where is our JSP file locate
----->app.xml


Controller: will handle the request



ENUM and Optional:

OPTIONAL:
"If data is der then it retrieve and give otherwise it dont give us the rror.It displays blank/ aor we can display default msgs.

What is Optional?

Optional is a container object that may or may not contain a value.
It helps avoid NullPointerException by handling null safely.




ENUM is used to set of value which are constant.







Spring JDBC


How to add depenency:
Create new Spring project(strter spring)-->in depedency page search with JDBC---> Select JDBC API and H2 database--> Finish.

Spring JDBC is a Spring module that simplifies database access using JDBC.
👉 It removes:
Boilerplate code
Manual connection handling

Controller
   ↓
Service
   ↓
Repository (DAO)
   ↓
JdbcTemplate
   ↓
Database (H2 / MySQL)

Interceptor:
It's a mediator, which get invoked before or after ur actual code.
It allow us to modify the incoming request before our request reaching to the controller.
Handler interceptor is a interface provided by Sppring 

Implents HandlerIntercepter

1. Create one Intercepter class with implements HandlerInterceptor(implement the methods)
2. Create a confoguration class
----> class should be implemnets with WebMvcConfiguraer
Override addInterceptiors method




1. Creation of Custom 
We can create custom Annotation using keyword "@interface" java application.

public @interface MycustomAnno{
public class User{

@MycustomAnno
void updtae(){
//b/s logic 
}}



2. important meta annotation properties are:

@target: zthid mea annotation, tell where we can apply the particular annotation on method or clss or cinstructor

@Target(ElementType.METHOD/CONSTRUCTOR/PARAMETER/FIELD)
public @interface Custom{
public class class_name{
}}



Filter: It intercept the HTTP request and response, before they reach to the servlet.
We put filter when the Logic is same for all the server.

Interceptor: It's spcific to Spring framwork, and intercept HTTP request and reposne, before they reach to the Controller and after the servlet.
Anything we want to add logic to the particular servlet then we go for Interceptor


HATEOAS
The API response itself tells the client what to do next.
So instead of the client guessing URLs, the server sends links.

y we use:
loose coupling
API discover
