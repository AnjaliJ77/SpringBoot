AOP-Aspect Oriented Programming
AOP is a programming approach used to separate cross-cutting concerns from business logic.
Oops as Classes likewise AOP as aspects
AOP allo us to focus on Business logic by handling boilerplate and repatative code like logging, Transaction managemnet etc.
Helps in achieving reusabality, maintainability of the code.


These are functionalities that are needed across many modules, like:
Logging
Security
Transaction management
Exception handling
Performance monitoring
❌ Without AOP → repeated code everywhere
✅ With AOP → centralized & clean code


we need to add dependency inside our POM>XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>
----------------------------------------
Problem WITHOUT AOP ❌
public void transferMoney() {
    log.info("method started");
    // business logic
    log.info("method ended");
}



1. Aspect

👉 A class that contains cross-cutting logic
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect { }

2. Advice
👉 When the code should run
Types:
@Before
@After
@AfterReturning
@AfterThrowing
@Around

3. Join Point
👉 Where advice executes
(Method execution, exception, return)

4. Pointcut
👉 Which methods should be intercepted
execution(* SB.AOP.Empdata.*(..))

5. Target Object
👉 The actual business class (Empdata)

6. Proxy
👉 A wrapper object created by Spring
(all AOP happens via proxy)

⚠️ No proxy = no AOP

4️⃣ How AOP works internally (MUST KNOW)
Spring starts
Scans beans
Finds @Aspect
Creates proxy object
Calls proxy instead of real object
Advice runs → then method executes
