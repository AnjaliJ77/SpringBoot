Maven:
Apache Maven is a build automation and dependency management tool used in Java projects to manage project dependencies, build lifecycle, and project structure.

Project management tool. helps developer with:
Build generation
Deoendency resolution
Documentation etc.

Maven uses POM(prjct object model) to achieve this.
When maven command is given, it looks for "pom.xml in the current directory & get needed configuration.




Mvn life cycle:
If we want to run the "Package phase all it's prebious phase will get execute first.
Each phases has goals(multiple goals/task)
If we want to run a particular task (for ex. package), then all goals of previous pahsases + current phase goals/task will get run first.

1. validate – checks project structure
Maven already has validate phase defined and it's goal, but if we =want to add more goals/task, then we can use <build> element to add the goal to specific phase.
Command: mvn validate

.
2. compile – compiles source code
Conbvert from java code to byte code and put it under target file.
mvn compile


3. test – runs unit tests
It validate , compile and test in our prjct(unit TCs)
mvn test

4. package – creates JAR/WAR
It completees the task till test phase and then run package phase in which it generates .jar/.war file.
ot build jar into target file.
mvn package


5. verify – verifies the quality
verify runs checks to ensure the project is valid and meets quality standards before installation or deployment.
we can perform some additional 
Integration tests
SonarQube analysis
Code coverage checks (JaCoCo)
Quality gates
====mvn verify

6. install – installs package into local repo
It install .jar package into the local repo, them dot m2 folder will get created
if we want to chaneg anything , we can change it in setting.xml
--- mvn install

7. deploy – deploys to remote repo
Deploy the .jar to remote repo
inside distribution managemnet we should ptrovide the repo url(inside pom).
Inside setting we have to give user id and pwd
-----mvn deploy





Note:    Remote repo======Maven central(public)   Out side of the sysytem.
Local repo====My system
