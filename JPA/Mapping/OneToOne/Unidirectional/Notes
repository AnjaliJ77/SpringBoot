Mapping:

@one to one Unidirectional:
(Like a one user can have a one address)
 One entity(A) referance only one instance of another entity(B)
But referance exist only in one direction i.e from Parent(A) to Child(B).

By default hibernate choose:
the foreign key anme as: Field name id
But if we need more control over it, we can use @JoinColumn annotation.



Cascade type:
Without Cascade type, any operation on Parent do not affect Child entity.
Managing child entities explicitly can be error prone.
1. ALL:


2.PERSIST
Inserting Parent entity automatically persist its associated child entity data.

3. MERGE
updating the parent entity automatically update the child

4. REMOVE

5. REFRESH: 
and
6. DETACH: 
less frequently used.
