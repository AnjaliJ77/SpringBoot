UUID and H2 Database:

UUID = Random unique ID
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
It is just a very long random ID.

Nobody can guess next ID.
So it is:
✔ More secure
✔ Hard to guess
✔ Good for public APIs

UUID = Random unique ID that improves security and avoids ID conflicts.
H2 Database is a lightweight Java database.

It is mostly used for:
✔ Testing
✔ Development
✔ Learning Spring Boot

Why We Use H2?
Because:
No need to install MySQL
Runs inside your Spring Boot app
Starts automatically
Very fast
