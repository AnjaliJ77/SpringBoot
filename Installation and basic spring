Spring------------------
Spring is a Java framework used to build enterprise and web applications easily by:
Reducing boilerplate code
Managing objects automatically
Supporting microservices, REST APIs, security, data access, etc.
“An enterprise application is a large, scalable, secure software system that supports critical business processes for organizations.”

Why Spring is Popular?
✔ Loose coupling(Not dependent on one cls to other class)
✔ Easy testing
✔ Microservices support
✔ Industry standard
✔ Used with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

What is Modular Architecture?

Modular Architecture is a design approach where an application is divided into small, independent, well-defined modules, and each module is responsible for one specific functionality.


Container
“A container in Spring is a runtime environment that manages beans, their dependencies, and their lifecycle.”

In Spring, a Container is a core framework component that:
👉 Creates, manages, and destroys objects (called Beans)
👉 Injects dependencies (IOC & DI)
👉 Manages the entire lifecycle of beans

IOS:
IOC is a principle where the responsibility of creating and managing objects is given to the framework instead of the developer.”


IOC = Rule
“Students should not cook food themselves”
Container = Kitchen

IOC is a design principle, whereas the Spring Container is the framework component that implements IOC.
“The kitchen prepares and serves food”






IOC(Inversion of control):(inversion mean we are giving the control to someone else);
IOC is just a prnciple/philosophy, we neean technick to do it.
DI(Dependents the injection) comes to the picture.
To acheive IOC we use DI depends the injection
IOS Container is like a space(where spring wio create object and store)


DI(dependent Injection): 
It's a design patter

Injector example(we need CPU to run Laptop(we have to inject CPU into Laptop)
Class CPU{
}

class Laptop{
CPU cpu;
}



Installation
in Eclipse-->help--->marketplace--> search with spring tool and choose 
Spring Tools (aka Spring Tool Suite) 5.x / 4.x and install


Spring in Maven:
1. Create maven project--> go to Mabven repo saerch with Spring context --> copy the code--> add that code into POM.xml file.
2. Inside main we should create resource folder-->and create xml file(Spring 6 bean conf xml search and add the code into xml)


SpringBoot
Creation of App;
Create project-->search spring(select Spring starter prjct)--> give name-->Artifact id name-->next-->finish

Objects is called beans

'@Autowired' in Spring is like telling the framework to automatically find and insert the right tools or parts your class needs, so you don't have to do it manually.


We have 2ways to work with spring
1. Xml based
2. javaConfiguration based

instead of writing all xml or annotation, we can just communicate with spring using @componentScan(Complete name of the clss")








Spring:
What is Singleton?
Singleton means only ONE object (instance) of a bean is created in the Spring container, and the same object is shared everywhere.
👉 This is the DEFAULT scope in Spring.
<bean id="prgrm" class="com.SpringMaven.Spring1.Maven.Prgrm" scope="singleton"></bean>
